We started by the generatePinId function that generate a random pin with 4 numbers and an Id that is unique for this part it checks the last user in the list if founded  ,it returns the last user id plus one if not it return ACC1001 the first account.
the second fuction was the adduser fuction that calls the previous fuction to generate a new id and pin then assing it to a new user whos name is given in the parametres of the fuction and push it in the users list 
the function  authenticateUser takes an accountid and pin then find it in the list of users then return the user informations
